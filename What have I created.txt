New line through Git, I like it:)

During last 4 months I've done this:

- reported more than 60 bugs via Jira and just above 15 in Visual Studio Online (goitgoqa.wix.com/gocupcake, CallsFreeCalls hybrid app for iOS, http://www.hromadske.tv/, https://beta.pibox.com);

- created a ton (30 :) ) of test cases and a test plan;

- conducted qualitative requirement analysis;

- prepared 2 QA (test) reports (for goitgoqa.wix.com/gocupcake, http://www.hromadske.tv/);

- run 3 performance tests in JMeter;

- produced 3 checklists;

- draw a bulk of mindmaps (+ I love UML);

- prepared 1 web testing environment (Selenium IDE + Intellij Idea).

- created and will hopefully keep my Git stuff up-to-date.

All QA documents are available upon request.

Don't hesitate to contact me!

Best regards,
Dmytro Gavryshchyshyn
